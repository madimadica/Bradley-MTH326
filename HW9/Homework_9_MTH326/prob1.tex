The results that were obtained from an analysis of data obtained in a study to assess the relationship between percent increase in yield ($Y$) and base saturation ($x_1$, pounds/acre), phosphate saturation ($x_2$, BEC\%), and spoil pH ($x_3$). Fifteen responses were analyzed in the study. The least-squares equation and other useful information follow.
