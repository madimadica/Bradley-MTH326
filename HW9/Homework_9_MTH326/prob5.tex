In class we stated the MLE for $\widehat{\mu}_i$ and ${S_a}^2$ under the alternative hypothesis that all the means are not equal. Using the likelihood function $L( \text{all } Y_{i\,j} \mid \widehat{\mu}_1 , \dots, \widehat{\mu}_k, {S_a}^2)$ that we derived in class, show that the MLE is as stated in class. (Hint: Recall that when using this method to determine $\that$, we differentiate with respect to the whole of the estimator $\displaystyle \pdv{\that}$)
