Report the $p$-value and interpret the $p$-value in the context of the problem

\soln* Computing the $p$-value (which I wasn't going to code or import an F-distibution) with the WebAssign technology, we get $p = 0.043377$. In the context of the problem we can be at most $95.66\%$ confident that at least one of the nutrient packages differs significantly from the others.
