AAA reports a study in which 171 out of 880 randomly selected drivers admitted running a red light in the recent past.  Assuming those polled answered honestly, find a 90\% confidence interval for the percentage of all drivers who have run a red light in the recent past.
\begin{mybox}
\textbf{Solution: } Let $\hat{p} := \{\text{percentage that ran red light}\}$, then $\hat{p} = \dfrac{171}{880} = 0.1943\overline{18}$. Then the error, $E$, is
$$E = Z_{\alpha/2}\sqrt{\frac{pq}{n}}  = 1.645\sqrt{\frac{ 0.1943\overline{18}(1- 0.1943\overline{18})}{880} } \approx 0.02194133593790251569487435507$$
Thus the interval 90\% confidence interval is ($0.1943\overline{18} \pm E$), also known to be  approximately
$$\pars{0.1723768458802793024869438267502493,\;  0.2162595177560843338766925368861143}$$
