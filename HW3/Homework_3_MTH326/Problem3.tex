\section{}
A study reported by Steele and Torrie wanted to measure the strength of hydrogen sulfide produced by sewage over 42 hours in warm conditions.  As the actual contents of the sewage varied from run to run, $n=9$ different observations were collected; these observations had mean $\bar{X}=218$ ppm and $S=11.1$ ppm.  We want to estimate $\mu$, the mean amount of hydrogen sulfide produced over the population of all sewage situations.
\subsection{}
    Determine the standard error of the mean.
    \begin{mybox}
        \textbf{Solution: } The standard error, $\sigma_{\xbar}$ is
        $$\sigma_{\xbar} = \sqrt{\frac{S^2}{n}} = \sqrt{\frac{11.1^2}{9}} = \frac{11.1}{3} = 3.7.$$
    \end{mybox}
    \vspace{1in}
\subsection{}
    Find a 99\% confidence interval for $\mu$.
    \begin{mybox}
        \textbf{Solution: } There are $n-1 = 8$ df, and 
        \begin{align}
            \mu &= \xbar \pm t_{\alpha/2}\pars{\frac{S}{\sqrt{n}}}\notag\\
            &= 218 \pm t_{0.005}\pars{\frac{11.1}{\sqrt{9}}}\notag\\
            &= 218 \pm 3.355 \cdot 3.7\notag\\
            &= 218 \pm 3.355 \cdot 3.7\notag\\
            &= 218 \pm 12.4135\notag
        \end{align}
        Therefore the 99\% C.I. for $\mu$ is $(205.5865\text{ ppm}, \; 230.4135\text{ ppm})$.
