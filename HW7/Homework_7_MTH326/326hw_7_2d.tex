A good rule of thumb for the correlation coefficient in regards to best-fit lines is that if $\rho^2$ is greater than $0.70$, then the line is a good model for the spread of the data. Is using a line a good model for this data?

\nl \textbf{Solution: } Based on this correlation coefficient this line is an egregious model of the data.
