Is the test you defined in part (a) uniformly most powerful for the alternative $\theta > \theta_0$?
    Briefly explain your answer.

    \nl \textbf{Solution: } The critical region $C$ does not depend on a specific alternative $\theta_a$ with $\theta_a > \theta$. Therefore the test is a uniformly most powerful (UMP) test of size $\alpha$.
