Suppose a new burger on the market is known to have 650 calories. What is a good
    estimate for how much fat is in the burger?

    \nl \textbf{Solution: } Since the calorie count is the $y$ value of our regression line, we substitute it in for $y$. Thus,
    \begin{align*}
        & y = 650 = \dfrac{51500 + 4570x}{377} \\
        \iff & 245050 = 51500 + 4570x\\
        \iff & 193550 = 4570x\\
        \iff & x = \frac{19355}{457} \approx 42.352\\
    \end{align*}
    Hence the expected value for the grams of fat in a burger with 650 calories is approximately 42.352 grams.
