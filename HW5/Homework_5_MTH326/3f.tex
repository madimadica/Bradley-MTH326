The variance of $U$ is finite because we showed $U$ to be an MVUE and all one-variable functions with an MVUE guarantee the existance of finite variance. 

\nl Analytically, suppose that $U$ had infinite variance, then $U$ couldn't have an MVUE since the minimum \textit{variance} of infinity would be infinite; and thus not the minimum.
